# SummerProject
This project applies spectral clustering techniques to uncover patterns and community structures within complex datasets. Using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and NetworkX, it explores how graph-based similarity measures and Laplacian matrices can be used to group related entities. The analysis demonstrates how spectral clustering can reveal hidden relationships in data, with applications to domains like network analysis and recommendation systems.
